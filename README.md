# Features
- Easy templating with native JS objects
- Simple reactivity with exposing functions and subscribing to them from other elements

# Roadmap
- Automatically let lists generate based on input data and a flag within the template to enable it
- Continually check for `condition` statements and make rendering dynamic (at the moment this only happens at template resolving time)
- Enable recursion with defined depth levels and data for each level

# Issue tracking
- Please use **Github Issues** for bug reports, feature suggestions, etc.
